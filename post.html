        <p>The white space is just as important as the text in a poem,<br>
            whether itâ€™s the counter that shapes an O or S,<br> 
            a line break after a word or a caesura within a line.<br>
            With space, one can shape sound and language to create a poetic field.<br> 
            And with that, one may express a silence. When we write or type,<br> 
            our focus seems to be on a small percentage of the paper, which is,<br> 
            where the text is placed. But around it there lies a pause,<br> 
            a momentary rest that hibernates. </p>
